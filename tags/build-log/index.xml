Featuring internal weight engravings, but a clean external weight, itâ€™s almost a shame to cover up such cute engravings. Designed by Justterry, I was very excited to assemble a board by an Australian designer and a friend.
I built this board with TX 1.2t clip in stabilisers and broken in Kailh Cream switches. The switches have been spring swapped with 67g TX springs, using stock lubricant.</description></item></channel></rss>
